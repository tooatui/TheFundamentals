## Things hard to understand
- print function in python 2 vs 3 (print is a statement vs function)
https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/python-print


## Things that are new to me (in python, but not in Java, C# etc.)
- [Predefined Class Attributes](http://www2.lib.uchicago.edu/keith/courses/python/class/5/), e.g. ``ClassName.__doc__``
- tuple vs list

## Things that are different in other languages
### logical operators
keywords are more of natural languages: e.g. ```and, or, not,``` rather than ```&&, ||, !```
``` 
a = False
b = True

if a and b:
    print("a and b is true")

if a or b:
    print("a or b is true")

if not a
    print("a is not true")
```

### Ternary if statements 
```
# Ternary if statements 
a = 5
b = 6

print("bigger" if a > b else "smaller")
```
