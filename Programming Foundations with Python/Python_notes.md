## Things hard to understand
- print function in python 2 vs 3 (print is a statement vs function)

## Things that are new to me (in python, but not in Java, C# etc.)
- [Predefined Class Attributes](http://www2.lib.uchicago.edu/keith/courses/python/class/5/), e.g. ``ClassName.__doc__``

## Things that are different in other languages
### Ternary if statements 
```
# Ternary if statements 
a = 5
b = 6

print("bigger" if a > b else "smaller")
```
